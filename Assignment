1.Difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler:

FIFO Scheduler:

Scheduler is a process by which resources are allocated to applicaitons.
FIFO stands for First In First Out.
The FIFO Scheduler follows first in first out stratedgy i.e, it places the applications in a queue and executes them.

Cons:
A small file has to wait until the large file preceding it in the queue to execute first which is time inefficient.
	
Capactiy Scheduler:

It runs the MapReduce in a shared manner while maximising throughput.
Capacity Scheduler allocates shared cluster resources among users and groups.
It helps to share the available resources in the Hadoop cluster among multiple organizations 
while giving them a minimum capacity guarantee.
It provides cost effective access to Hadoop clusters for the organizations.


2.Limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x:

In hadoop1.x only single namenode manages the entire namespace.
It acts as a single point of failure. 
If the name node fails the entire cluster fails.

In hadoop2.x, Multiple namenodes are used in the namespace.(HDFS Federation)
Multiple namenodes are present in an active-standby mode.(High Availability)
In case of failure of the active namenode the standby namenode takes care of the cluster,therefore single point of failure doesnot happen.
In hadoop 2.x the number of nodes has been scaled up from 4000 to 10000.
